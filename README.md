How to design a Compiler from scratch?

These are the series of assignments that I did to learn the priniciples of Compiler Design. The assignments here are a part of my curriculum for B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar.

Based on these concepts, I have designed a programmable-computer comprising of a novel 32-bit RISC processor, an assemnbler, a compiler and a native programming language for the machine.
